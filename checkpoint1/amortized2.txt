What is the time complexity of the following code :


        int j = 0;
        for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while(j < n && arr[i] < arr[j]) {
                j++;
            }
        }

Answer: O(n)

Reasoning: The inner loop only ever runs n time ONCE in the worst case. The outer loop runs n times. So inner loop is asymptotically a constant resulting overall O(n).
